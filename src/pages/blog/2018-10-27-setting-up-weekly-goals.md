title: Setting Up Weekly Goals

I mentioned in my previous article about my struggle to manage and complete my side projects. While I got better at time management and organization, I still struggle to keep my momentum. 

In hopes of getting better at being accountable, I limit my goals to one-week time frame to finish them. I would set up a small list of no more than three or four goals to complete by the end of the week. These goals have to be doable within that time frame. By the end of each week. I would reflect on these goals and evaluate my progress. 

To be more disciplined, I would tweet my goals with a [#myWeeklyGoals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23myWeeklyGoals%20&src=typd) hashtag. I feel like announcing my goals to the public puts more pressure on me to commit to them. By the end of the week, I would also tweet about progress. 

Here is why Iâ€™m really interested in trying weekly goals method.


- **It forces me to break down my goals into smaller tasks with limited scope:** I have a huge list of broad project ideas and I never attempted to tackle them because I am intimidated by their large scope. Having tasks broken into smaller actionable ones makes them more approachable.
- **Enables me to have better life balance:** For example, I sometimes feel guilty for having fun because there is this pressing feeling that I should be doing something productive. Having weekly goals means I can have a better reward system in my life. Once I can feel confident that I will complete my goals within a week, I can reward myself and have carefree fun. 
- **Better discipline:** There are tasks which are no fun to do but required (called being an adult) such as calling the insurance company, laundry, meal prep, etcâ€¦ Weekly goals along with reward system help me get better at those kinds of tasks. 
- **Better focus:** Having set goals for the week prevents me from being tempted to switch to other tasks or projects. 

Finally, I also want to clarify that goals can be literally anything you want and not limited to professional ones. Here is an example of some goals I might set for my self in the future: 

- Finishing certain number of chapters of a book Iâ€™m reading
- Going to the gym 5 times a week
- Finishing up a tutorial to learn a particular tech.
- Build one or two small core features of a side project
- Cook my own meals at least 3 times within a week
- Finish a blog post

Join me in this initiative, share your goals on twitter [#myWeeklyGoals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23myWeeklyGoals%20&src=typd). post updates regularly. I will be starting my self too ðŸ™‚.
